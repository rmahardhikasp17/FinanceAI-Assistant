# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Blank White Page**: Caused by incorrect Vercel configuration and MIME type issues
2. **JavaScript Module Loading**: Script tags not loading due to routing issues
3. **Service Worker 401 Errors**: PWA features conflicting with Vercel deployment

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`

- Fixed routing configuration using `rewrites` instead of `routes`
- Added proper API function configuration
- Ensured SPA fallback routing works correctly

### 2. Simplified `index.html`

- Removed service worker registration temporarily
- Removed complex PWA manifest references
- Kept only essential meta tags and favicon

### 3. Verified Build Process

- Confirmed `pnpm build` generates correct output in `dist/spa`
- Verified asset references are correct in built HTML

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push these changes** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Vercel** - it should automatically pick up the new configuration
3. **Add Environment Variable**: Make sure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables

## Expected Result

After redeployment, you should see:

- ✅ The FinanceAI chat interface loads properly
- ✅ Aurora gradient background and styling
- ✅ Chat functionality works with API endpoints
- ✅ No more 401 errors for manifest/service worker

## Optional: Re-enable PWA Features Later

Once the basic app is working, you can gradually re-add:

- Service worker registration
- PWA manifest
- Offline functionality

The core functionality will work without these features.
